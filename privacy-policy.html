    <h2>Last Updated: November 11, 2025</h2>
    
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Lettie ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>
    
    <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Data:</strong> We collect information you provide when creating recommendation packets, including student names, achievements, academic information, and other details you enter into the app.</li>
        <li><strong>API Keys:</strong> If you choose to use our AI-powered features, you may provide API keys (such as Gemini API keys) which are stored securely on your device. We do not have access to your API keys.</li>
        <li><strong>App Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous usage statistics to improve our services.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Basic device information may be collected for app functionality and troubleshooting.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription Information:</strong> If you purchase a subscription, payment information is processed by Apple through the App Store. We do not store your payment details.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To generate recommendation letter packets and content</li>
        <li>To improve our app's features and user experience</li>
        <li>To provide customer support</li>
        <li>To manage your subscription and provide premium features</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Data Storage and Security</h3>
    <p><strong>All data processing occurs locally on your device.</strong> Your recommendation packets, user data, and API keys are stored securely on your device. <strong>We do not transmit your personal data or recommendation packets to our servers.</strong> All packet generation and processing is performed using the API keys you provide, and we do not have access to your data or API keys.</p>
    
    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>Lettie uses third-party AI services (such as Google Gemini or other AI providers) through API keys that you provide.

We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of any AI service providers you choose to use.</p>
    
    <p>We may use third-party services for analytics and app functionality. These services have their own privacy policies.</p>
    
    <h3>Your Rights</h3>
    <p>You have the right to access, modify, or delete your personal information. You can do this through the app settings or by contacting us. Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can delete the app at any time to remove all your data.</p>
