    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    
    <h4>What is a recommendation packet?</h4>
    <p>A recommendation packet is a comprehensive document that helps your recommenders write strong letters of recommendation. It includes your achievements, key themes, impact bullets, story maps, and draft paragraphs that highlight your strengths.</p>
    
    <h4>How does Lettie generate recommendation packets?</h4>
    <p>Lettie uses AI technology (via API keys you provide) to analyze your information and generate personalized recommendation letter content. The app creates brag sheets, impact bullets, story maps, and draft paragraphs tailored to your profile.</p>
    
    <h4>Is my data stored or shared?</h4>
    <p>No. All data is stored locally on your device. We do not store, upload, or share your recommendation packets or personal information with any servers or third parties. When you use AI features, your data is sent to the AI service provider (e.g., Google Gemini) according to their privacy policy, but we do not retain this data.</p>
    
    <h4>Do I need an API key to use Lettie?</h4>
    <p>Yes, to use the AI-powered packet generation features, you'll need to provide an API key from an AI service provider (such as Google Gemini). You can add your API key in the app settings. The API key is stored securely on your device and we do not have access to it.</p>
    
    <h4>How accurate are the generated packets?</h4>
    <p>The packets are generated based on the information you provide and AI analysis. For best results, provide detailed and accurate information about your achievements, experiences, and goals. Always review and customize the generated content to ensure it accurately represents you.</p>
    
    <h4>Can I export my recommendation packets?</h4>
    <p>Yes! Lettie allows you to export your recommendation packets as PDF files, which you can share with your recommenders or save for your records.</p>
    
    <h4>What languages does Lettie support?</h4>
    <p>Lettie supports multiple languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Polish, Turkish, Arabic, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), and Russian.</p>
